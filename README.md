# learnplus_lms
I made this project only on the backend and i got the frontend(template) from templateshub.net

notes:
1. There are 3 types of user in this app, they are admin, teacher, and student
2. To register and login as an admin, use /logreg-admin on your localhost link. Use /logreg for the rest
3. Actually this one is depended on your wants. but i suggest you to make a database named learnplus then import the .sql file to that learnplus database 
   so you don't need to change the configuration inside the .env and config/database.php
   
Thank you and use this wisely
